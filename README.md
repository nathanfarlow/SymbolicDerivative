# SymbolicDerivative
A symbolic derivative solver for TI 84+ CE calculators

You can download the current build from bin/DERIV.8xp until I set it up in github's releases. As of right now, the program uses the equation in Y1 and puts the simplified derivative in Y2.

## Why?
Because my calc teacher didn't think I could do it
